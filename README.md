# Multi-Format Document Chat üìö

A powerful Streamlit-based application that enables interactive conversations with multiple document formats using LangChain and local LLM integration. This application allows users to upload various document types and engage in context-aware conversations about their content.

## Features üåü

- **Multi-Format Support**: Process various document formats including:
  - PDF (.pdf)
  - Text files (.txt)
  - CSV files (.csv)
  - Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
  - Word documents (.docx, .doc)

- **Advanced Document Processing**:
  - Automatic text splitting with smart chunk overlap
  - Vector embeddings using HuggingFace's sentence transformers
  - Local vector storage using FAISS

- **Interactive Chat Interface**:
  - Context-aware conversations
  - Source document attribution
  - Chat history management
  - Relevancy scoring for responses

- **User-Friendly Features**:
  - Real-time document processing
  - Source verification
  - Response relevancy calculation
  - Clean and intuitive UI
